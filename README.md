# Jobly Project

This application will be built using the battle-tested PERN stack - **P**ostgreSQL, **E**xpress, **R**eact, and **N**ode.

Checkout our [live demo page](http://jobly-codepath-react-ui.surge.sh/)!

## Project Setup

To get you started with the project, we have provided you with the backend solution (express-jobly)

1. Re-create the jobly database from the backend solution using jobly.sql.
2. Create a new React project. It may help to take a few minutes to look over the backend to remind yourself of the most important routes.
3. Start up the backend. We have it starting on port 3001, so you can run the React front end on 3000.

A big skill in learning React is to learn to design component hierarchies. It can be very helpful to sketch out a hierarchy of components, especially for larger apps, like Jobly.

Take time to diagram what components you think youâ€™ll need in this application, and what the most important parts of state are, and where they might live.

  Notice how some things are common: the appearance of a job on the company detail page is the same as on the jobs page. You should be able to re-use that component.
